# Zsh Scripts

This directory is a placeholder for Zsh equivalents of the Fish scripts.

## Status: Contributions Welcome!

The main implementation uses Fish shell. Zsh ports of the following scripts would be appreciated:

- `hyprland-tty.zsh` - Equivalent of `scripts/fish/hyprland-tty.fish`
- `hyprland-autostart.zsh` - Equivalent to be sourced from `.zprofile`

See the [Shell Compatibility](../../README.md#shell-compatibility) section in the main README for translation hints.

## Contributing

If you've adapted these scripts for Zsh, please open a PR! Include:

1. The converted scripts
2. Any Zsh-specific considerations or gotchas
3. What you tested it on (distro, Zsh version, GPU)
